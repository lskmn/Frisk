# Frisk Theme

## How to install
The installation process is pretty easy!
Simply download the .zip above and throw it into the root folder of your webspace.
If you already have a kirby starterkit running, delete the `assets`, `content` and `site` folders and replace them with the folders from this theme-package.

If you want to change the main color of this theme, simply go to the site-settings in your panel.

The theme comes with the Features-page from this demo, which shows you how to use all the different elements in Markdown and Kirbytext. Make sure to have a look at how to use these cool buttons, or the columns. ;)
